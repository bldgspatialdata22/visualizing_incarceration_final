About this site

This site was made for the final project for GES 660. GES 660 was taught by [Eli Pousson](https://elipousson.github.io/) at UMBC in the GES department.

In **GES 660: Building Spatial Datasets** we are learning how to work with spatial data for research and practice with open-source tools. One of those tools we are encouraged to use is quarto with R and github. This class was my first exposure to quarto and quarto sites.
